;;; Commentary:

;; defshell.el makes it easy to run different inferior shells at the
;; same time, by defining new commands for the Bourne (M-x sh), C (M-x
;; csh), Korn (M-x ksh), and Bourne Again (M-x bash) shells.  And
;; whereas the `M-x shell' command defined in Emacs' shell.el always
;; reuses the *shell* buffer, defshell.el can be customized via the
;; defshell-reuse-buffer and defshell-rename-buffer-uniquely options
;; (e.g. for `M-x sh') to reuse the *sh* buffer or create a *sh*<2> (or
;; *sh*<N>) buffer.
;; 
;; defshell.el also provides the `defshell' macro to define additional
;; shell commands.  E.g. to define the Foo shell (M-x fsh):
;; 	(defshell "/bin/fsh" "Foo")
;; or to define a DNS lookup shell (M-x nslookup):
;; 	(defshell "/usr/sbin/nslookup" "DNS lookup")
;; and since `nslookup` doesn't accept the -i option:
;; 	(setq explicit-nslookup-args '())
